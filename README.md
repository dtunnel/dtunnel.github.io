# Game Of The Week Showcase üéÆ‚ú®

Welcome to the **Game Of The Week Showcase** repository! This project hosts a dynamic, single-page website that features a curated list of recommended games, updated weekly.

## üåü About This Project

The "Game Of The Week Showcase" is a personal project designed to share exciting game recommendations with friends, family, and the wider gaming community. Each week, a new set of games (or a single game) is highlighted, providing:

*   **Customized Descriptions:** Unique insights and commentary on why each game is worth checking out.
*   **Steam Integration:** Quick links to the official Steam page and user reviews.
*   **Visuals:** Steam header images for each game.
*   **Pricing Information:** MSRP details to help users make informed decisions.
*   **Sales Insights:** Notes on historical sales data from sources like SteamDB.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, interactive, and themeable (light/dark mode) website.

The website is automatically generated from a CSV data source, ensuring that updates are streamlined and consistent.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Interactive Game Browser:** Easily navigate through the list of featured games.
*   **Detailed Game Pages:** Click on a game to see its cover art, full description, pricing, sales info, and links.
*   **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Switch between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
*   **Responsive Design (Basic):** Adapts to different screen sizes for a good experience on desktop and mobile.
*   **Automated Generation:** The website HTML is generated by a Python script from a CSV file, making weekly updates simple.
*   **No External Dependencies (for viewing):** The generated website runs directly in the browser using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Technical Overview)

1.  **Data Source:** Game information is maintained in a CSV file (`game-of-the-week-automated - Old GOTW (1).csv`). This includes game names, Steam links, custom descriptions, review links, MSRP, and sales notes.
2.  **Python Script (`generate_website.py`):**
    *   Reads the CSV data.
    *   Parses and processes the information (e.g., converting markdown links, handling newlines).
    *   Injects the game data into an HTML template.
    *   Outputs a single `game_showcase_generated.html` file.
3.  **Website (`game_showcase_generated.html`):**
    *   A single-page application (SPA) built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
    *   Dynamically displays game lists and detail cards based on the injected data.
    *   Manages theme toggling and UI interactions.
4.  **Automation (Optional - For Maintainer):**
    *   A shell script (`update_gotw_github.sh`) can be used to automate the process of:
        *   Pulling the latest changes from this GitHub repository.
        *   Running the Python generation script.
        *   Committing and pushing the updated HTML file back to GitHub.
    *   This can be scheduled with a cron job for weekly updates.

## üí° Future Ideas (Potential Enhancements)

*   Search/Filter functionality for games.
*   User-submitted game suggestions (would require a backend).
*   More advanced sorting options (e.g., by price, by date added).
*   Integration of game trailers or more screenshots.
*   Tagging/Categorization of games.
*   Directly integrating PC Game Pass status checks via an API (if feasible and reliable).
